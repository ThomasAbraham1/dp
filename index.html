  <h3>About me:</h3>
  <p>
    I am from Tamilnadu which is one of the states in India, it's really a messy place to live in when we've places like America in this world.
    But yet, this can really be an exciting experience living in here which those rich people living out there in the comfort could never imagine of.
    Don't mistake me for sympathizing, the experience we've here is undisputable and cherishable, we can't have the experience of being in America and so
    can't they have our pleasant experience being in one of the places that's remarkable for it's ancient culture.

  <h3>Who's god?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      He's the only person who cares, alright? The only person who'd care no matter what of a bad / evil thing you did in the past, his love pulls you off your previous sinful life and saves your from eternal damnation. He'll give you a new life where everything happens as you like, you'll be tested by Satan when you're weak but he'll save you for you'll always have faith in him.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always listen to him, love him and pray to him and he shall respond to you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always seek him when you're not in danger and in danger.
    </li>
  </ul>
